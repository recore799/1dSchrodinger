#+title: Numerov

* Methods that have been thoroughly tested

** Integrator class

+ [X] numerov

** Shooting class

+ [X] count_nodes
+ [X] boundary
+ [ ] bracket_eigenvalue
  Works, but have to improve error handling:
  - [ ] When E_min is a node I get UnboundLocalError
  - [ ] When there are no energy brackets with the requested number of nodes
+ [ ] eigenvalue
+ [ ] solve_state
